## JOT: Optimal Transport Library in Julia

This open source library in [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) is motivated by the following:
1. [**Optimal Transport in Python**](https://github.com/rflamary/POT).
2. MATLAB codes of [**Marco Cuturi**](http://marcocuturi.net/).

This library provides optimization problem solvers related to **Optimal Transport problems**. The following solvers are provided:
1. **Sinkhorn Distance solver** [1]
2. **Earth Movers Distance**
3. **Linear OT**
